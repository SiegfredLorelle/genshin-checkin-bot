# Story 1.3: Integrated Browser Automation and Research

## Status  
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement browser automation that can navigate HoYoLAB and analyze the interface dynamically,
**so that** I can build adaptive automation based on real-time interface analysis rather than assumptions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Browser automation successfully launches headless Chrome/Chromium and navigates to HoYoLAB login page using primary framework (Playwright)
2. Authentication flow completes using hardcoded credentials for initial MVP validation (personal account with careful procedures)

4. Script implements proper wait conditions, screenshot capture, and graceful error handling for common failures
5. Automation generates detailed interface analysis report documenting discovered selectors, timing requirements, and potential bot detection measures
6. Framework evaluation completes with documented decision criteria: if Playwright fails or causes issues, automatic fallback to Selenium WebDriver with documented switching procedure
7. Browser automation abstraction layer implemented to support seamless switching between Playwright and Selenium without code restructuring

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements the core browser automation and interface analysis capabilities required for adaptive HoYoLAB automation. It builds on the project structure from Story 1.2 and leverages the browser abstraction layer to create robust automation that can adapt to interface changes.

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion: Complete project structure and browser abstraction layer established with Playwright as primary framework and Selenium as fallback. All dependency management, logging configuration, and development environment properly configured for automation implementation.

### Architecture Implementation Requirements

**Core Components to Implement** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- **AutomationOrchestrator**: Main entry point coordinating complete workflow from authentication through interface analysis with proper error handling and state logging
- **BrowserManager**: Browser lifecycle management with Playwright/Selenium abstraction, authentication flow, and anti-bot detection measures  
- **RewardDetector**: Intelligent reward detection using multiple CSS selector strategies and fallback mechanisms
- **ConfigurationManager**: Centralized configuration with secure credential access and selector strategy configuration
- **StateManager**: Execution logging and result tracking for workflow analysis

**Browser Automation Strategy** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Playwright ^1.40.0**: Primary framework for superior reliability, async support, built-in waiting strategies
- **Selenium WebDriver ^4.15.0**: Fallback option for platform compatibility  
- **Chromium**: Latest via Playwright for consistent rendering and automation
- **Abstraction Layer**: Enable seamless framework switching without code restructuring

**Authentication Flow Requirements** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]:
- Navigate to HoYoLAB login page with proper wait conditions
- Authenticate using cookie-based session management  
- Validate authentication success before proceeding
- Handle authentication failures with appropriate error reporting
- Maintain session state throughout automation workflow

**Interface Analysis Workflow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]:
- Dynamic CSS selector discovery for multiple detection strategies
- Primary selector with fallback options for reliability
- DOM inspection to identify reward availability states
- Screenshot capture for debugging and failure analysis
- Detailed reporting of discovered interface elements

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `src/automation/orchestrator.py`: AutomationOrchestrator implementation
- `src/browser/manager.py`: BrowserManager abstraction layer (already exists)
- `src/browser/playwright_impl.py`: Playwright implementation (already exists)
- `src/browser/selenium_impl.py`: Selenium fallback (already exists)

- `src/detection/strategies.py`: CSS selector strategies
- `src/config/manager.py`: ConfigurationManager implementation
- `src/state/manager.py`: StateManager implementation
- `src/utils/timing.py`: Anti-bot timing utilities

**Critical Automation Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Environment Variable Access: Always through ConfigurationManager, never os.environ directly
- Browser Resource Management: Always use context managers or try/finally blocks for cleanup
- Secret Handling: Never log credentials, implement secret redaction in logging
- Element Detection: Always implement timeout and retry logic for DOM elements
- Error Context: All exceptions must include debugging context without exposing secrets
- State Consistency: Always log execution results even on failure

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Hardcoded credentials for MVP validation only (migrate to GitHub Secrets in Epic 3)
- Comprehensive secret redaction in all logging output
- No credential exposure in error messages or debug output
- Secure session handling with proper cleanup

### Testing

**Testing Framework Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests Location**: `tests/unit/test_*.py` following pytest conventions
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_hoyolab_integration.py` for live testing
- **Fixtures**: `tests/fixtures/` for test data and mock responses
- **Mocking**: Use pytest-mock for test isolation and clean mock syntax
- **Browser Testing**: pytest-playwright for browser automation testing with async support
- **Test Organization**: Separate unit tests for each component (orchestrator, browser_manager, reward_detector, config_manager, state_manager)

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Unit tests for AutomationOrchestrator workflow logic without actual browser
- Unit tests for RewardDetector CSS selector strategies with mocked DOM
- Integration tests for complete authentication flow against live HoYoLAB
- Browser automation tests using pytest-playwright for framework validation
- Error handling tests for common failure scenarios (timeouts, element not found)
