# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Successfully implement basic automation functionality that maintains HoYoLAB daily check-in streaks for Genshin Impact players with **minimum 70% success rate over 30-day periods**
- Gain hands-on experience with GitHub Actions, web automation, and secure credential management practices
- Create comprehensive documentation that enables technically proficient users to replicate the automation setup
- Build a portfolio-worthy demonstration of modern DevOps automation patterns and security best practices
- **Validate core assumptions with at least 3 target users before Epic 2** to ensure market fit
- Document real-world challenges, failure modes, and lessons learned to provide educational value
- **Provide manual trigger fallback option** for critical streak maintenance during automation failures

## Background Context
The Genshin Impact Check-in Bot addresses a specific consistency challenge faced by dedicated Genshin Impact players: maintaining daily HoYoLAB reward streaks during travel, busy periods, or schedule conflicts. While manual check-ins take only 30 seconds, the cognitive load of daily execution over months creates friction for players who view reward collection as part of their gaming routine.

This project serves dual purposes - solving a gaming automation problem while providing practical learning opportunities in modern DevOps practices. The solution targets both optimization-focused players seeking systematic reward collection and convenience-focused players with technical aptitude who want reliable automation. The project acknowledges significant technical risks including website changes, bot detection measures, and cloud execution variability, while maintaining clear success criteria for both automation reliability AND educational value. When these goals conflict, automation reliability takes priority to ensure user value.
